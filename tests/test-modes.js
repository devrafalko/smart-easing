/*

When the new [Animation] instance is created
  it has the [Animation].modes property with [Modes] instance
  the [Animation].constructor.modes is a getter that returns the [Modes] instance

The [Modes] instance is a collection of easing modes
  where each mode is an [Array] set of [Number] items

The [Modes] instance should not
  have any other than public properties
  let to define any new methods, properties, getters and setters
  let to delete any existing methods, properties, getters and setters
  let to modify any existing methods, properties, getters and setters

the modes object should be accessible
  as the static getter of the smart-easing class
  as the modes getter of the instance
